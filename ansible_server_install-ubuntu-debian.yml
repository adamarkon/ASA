 # The following entry is to automatically enroll the server into your ScaleFT (ASA) project.
 # This example is using enrollment.token data coming from a network share or here in the playbook.
 # If you have enrollment.token in a remote location, you may wish to substitute the 'copy' module with 
 # the 'fetch' module.

            copy:
              src: /path/to/enrollment.token
  # Or instead of using a file, you can put the token string directly in the playbook 
  # (replace the src line above with the following content entry):
  #
  #        content: ' <<enrollment token data >> '
              dest:  /var/lib/sftd/enrollment.token
              owner: root
