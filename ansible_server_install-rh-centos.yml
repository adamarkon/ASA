# Sample Ansible playbook for installing ScaleFT agent and enrolling into corresponding project
# using 'yum' on CentOS, RedHat, and Fedora

  - name: ASA Server install - use to install ASA agent on PROD servers
# !! Be sure to change 'prod_servers' to your list of hosts here:
    hosts: prod_servers
    become: yes
    become_user: root
    tasks:

        -name: Trust the repository signing key:
         rpm_key:
          state: present
          key: https://dist.scaleft.com/pki/scaleft_rpm_key.asc

        - name: install scaleft-server-tools
          yum:
            enablerepo: https://pkg.scaleft.com/scaleft_yum.repo
            name: scaleft-server-tools
            state: installed

        - name: create the sftd directory for enrollment.token
          file:
            path: /var/lib/sftd
            owner: root
            group: root
            state: directory
            mode: '0700'
 
 # The following entry is to automatically enroll the server into your ScaleFT (ASA) project.
 # This example is using enrollment.token data coming from a network share or here in the playbook.
 # If you have enrollment.token in a remote location, you may wish to substitute the 'copy' module with 
 # the 'fetch' module.
 
        -name: Copy the enrollment token from network share to sftd directory
          copy:
           src: /path/to/enrollment.token
  # Or instead of using a file, you can put the token string directly in the playbook 
  # (replace the src line above with the following content entry):
  #
  #        content: ' <<enrollment token data >> '
           dest:  /var/lib/sftd/enrollment.token
           owner: root
           group: root
           mode: '0600'
